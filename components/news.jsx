          'Gene alterations in biliary tract cancer offer potential targets for current or future precision therapies. This is demonstrated by a highly acclaimed study conducted by Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences in collaboration with the Medical University of Vienna. In this study, cells from biliary tract cancer were examined for genetic alterations. The results demonstrate the potential of genetic profiling of tumors as a basis for promising and targeted therapies. Image Credit: Adobestock/Matthieu Advanced cancers of the biliary tract (BTC) are almost always fatal. With a current five-year survival probability of 2 percent, the search is on for new, effective treatments. One challenge is the high genetic variability and heterogeneity of tumor cells. In order to better exploit this variability for targeted therapies, it has now been systematically investigated. The team from the Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences (KL Krems) and the Medical University of Vienna used data from 92 affected patients in 3 centres in Austria as a basis. "Today\'s sequencing methods allow us to localize genetic alterations in tumor cells very precisely," explains Hossein Taghizadeh, MD-PhD from the Clinical Department of Internal Medicine 1 at St. P√∂lten University Hospital, one of the education and research sites of KL Krems, and first author of the study. "These alterations are something like target coordinates for modern, very efficient and precise cancer therapies. Based on data from affected individuals in Austria, we wanted our study to create a systematic genetic "map" of these target coordinates for BTC. At the same time, we aimed for showing that the methodology can be easily integrated into everyday clinical practice and that early tumor sequencing in advanced bile duct carcinoma should be established." Published internationally the analysis in the study provided extensive results. In fact, a total of 205 molecular genetic aberrations were found in 61 affected individuals. Only in 15 affected individuals were no aberrations detected at all, and in another 16 the sample material was not sufficient for analysis. The 205 aberrations included a total of 198 mutations occurring in 89 different genes. Other mismatches included those due to fusions of genes. Mutations of the KRAS and TP53 genes occurred most frequently (22.4 percent each). Both are "good acquaintances" in oncology, as their mutations are involved in the development of a whole range of different cancers. To assess the extent to which the mutations found would be suitable as targets for an existing precision therapy, the team led by Taghizadeh, MD-PhD, used the so-called ESCAT classification. This classifies cancer cell mutations according to their suitability as targets for precision therapy. "Our result showed that a quarter of all affected individuals with proven genetic abnormalities could benefit from precision therapies." Thus, the study clearly shows that bile duct cancer offers numerous potential targets for effective precision therapies. Based on our findings. We see a strong case for early molecular genetic profiling of BTC as part of the standard protocol ‚Äì preferably before initiating systemic therapy. In this way, potential target coordinates for precision therapies could be found early and treatment adjusted accordingly. Especially since our work also demonstrates the feasibility of the necessary analyses in everyday clinical practice." Hossein Taghizadeh, MD-PhD, Clinical Department of Internal Medicine 1, St. P√∂lten University Hospital. Thus, this study also supports the oncological research focus of KL Krems, which is on clinical research with high relevance for a rapid benefit for patients.

          "Bitcoin is struggling to break through the $27,500 resistance zone and may see a sharp decline towards $25,550 in the near future. The cryptocurrency is currently trading below $27,200 and the 100 hourly Simple Moving Average. It broke below a bullish trend line with support near $27,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. If the price fails to clear the $27,350 resistance, it could continue to move down towards immediate support at the $26,800 level, and potentially towards the $25,500 support level in the coming sessions. Technical indicators suggest a bearish trend. This article originally appeared on www.newsbtc.com The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing a roller coaster ride in the recent weeks, with the price of Bitcoin hovering around the $30,000 mark. While some may view this as a promising sign, technical analysts warn that the Bitcoin price topside bias could be vulnerable if it continues to struggle below the crucial $28,000 level. Bitcoin‚Äôs price performance in recent weeks has been less than stellar, with the cryptocurrency falling as much as 50% from its all-time high of around $64,000 in mid-April. However, the cryptocurrency has been able to maintain a strong support level around $30,000, a level which some traders believe is the bottom of the market. Despite the support level that Bitcoin has maintained, technical analysts warn that the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price topside bias could be vulnerable if it fails to break through the $28,000 resistance level. This resistance level has been a key barrier for the cryptocurrency since it began its downward trend in May. The main factor contributing to Bitcoin‚Äôs struggle is the increasing scrutiny of regulators around the world. As governments around the world formulate new regulations for cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin‚Äôs demand may be affected in the short term. Additionally, concerns about energy consumption and the environmental impact of Bitcoin mining have been raised, which could also have a negative effect on the cryptocurrency‚Äôs price. However, some analysts believe that Bitcoin‚Äôs price will eventually break through the resistance level and continue on an upward trend. They argue that the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency is positive as more institutional investors and corporations adopt it as a store of value. Moreover, Bitcoin‚Äôs recent price consolidation is actually a healthy development for the cryptocurrency market. It allows for a price correction and promotes a more sustainable upward trend, rather than a sudden spike in price that could lead to a market crash. In conclusion, while the Bitcoin price topside bias may be vulnerable if it continues to struggle below the $28,000 resistance level, the long-term outlook for the cryptocurrency market remains optimistic. While regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns may hamper the cryptocurrency‚Äôs demand in the short term, the increasing institutional adoption and the market‚Äôs consolidation are positive indicators for the future. It‚Äôs important for investors to remain patient and disciplined during this period of volatility and to focus on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency market. Source link",

        content:
          "Pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton has tipped less than a 3% chance for the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to score an outright win against Ripple, as an end to the long-running lawsuit draws closer. The CryptoLaw founder has been a vocal advocate for Ripple against the SEC, which filed a lawsuit against the company in December 2020, alleging that the sale of its XRP ( XRP ) token represented an unregistered securities offering. In a June 3 episode of The Good Morning Crypto podcast , Deaton said he tipped a 25% chance that presiding U.S. District Judge Torres rules in outright favor of Ripple, and a 50% chance that Ripple claims victory by way of a ‚Äúsplitting the baby‚Äù ruling. This refers to Judge Torress ‚Äúdrawing a line in the sand,‚Äù where she could potentially rule that XRP was offered as an unregistered security before 2018. However, in the wake of the Hinman documents ‚Äî which refer to internal SEC messages related to a 2018 speech given by former SEC Director William Hinman ‚Äî it‚Äôs possible that cryptocurrencies can transition from securities to commodities once they become sufficiently decentralized. ‚ÄúI think that XRP itself is going to be deemed not a security and that I think that secondary market sales show comment. Even if [Judge Torres] does rule finding that Ripple violated the law, that doesn't apply to secondary market sales,‚Äù Deaton explained. While Ripple executives including its CEO Brad Garlinghouse have long been predicting an imminent end to the rollercoaster lawsuit from SEC, Deaton highlighted that Judge Torres will most likely come to a final decision before Sept. 30 this year. Deaton brought attention to what he called a ‚Äúsix-month list‚Äù that district judges must file to Congress. The list details all of the summary judgements that have been pending for longer than six months. It gets published on the last day of March and the last day of September. Additionally, Deaton also gave his predictions for the price of Ripple‚Äôs native XRP token following a positive ruling. Related: Pro-XRP attorney‚Äôs phone hacked to promote LAW token Speaking to Cointelegraph on May 22 , Deaton said that the Ripple community should also keep a close eye on June 13, where investors will discover if XRP was actually discussed ‚Äúbetween SEC staff prior to the Hinman speech.‚Äù This date is when the Hinman materials will most likely be unsealed and could have a drastic impact on the case. There are also rumors circulating that Ripple may potentially IPO as a public company following the conclusion of the lawsuit. NEW: In April, @Ripple hosted a private \"road show\" (a marketing event where a company and its underwriters meet with potential investors to generate interest in an IPO). I'm told it was attended by just about every reputable institutional investment firm on the Street. https://t.co/fyTzi6pr0W According to a June 2 tweet from Fox Business journalist Eleanor Terrett, Ripple hosted a ‚Äúroad show‚Äù where it met with underwriters and other investors to garner interest in a potential public offering.

According to Kaleo in the same thread, XRP could be following in the footsteps of Tron (TRX), which recently rallied from a low of $0.74 to a high of $0.85. At the time of press, XRP is trading for $0.5369, with an 11.3% price surge in the last seven days, According to CoinMarketCap. Analyzing XRP against Bitcoin (XRP/BTC), Kaleo pointed out that the pair also looks poised to surge after breaking above its diagonal resistance. Meanwhile, fellow crypto strategist Cantering Clark is also bullish on XRP.

          "On a Deal to Suspend the US Debt Ceiling, Bitcoin Gains 4% The news that the U.S. government had reached a consensus on the debt limit caused BTC to soar to a three-week high. During the Asian trading session on Monday morning, cryptocurrency markets were up. A debt limit agreement reached by leading congressional Republican Kevin McCarthy and US President Joe Biden has given the movement impetus. The preliminary deal to raise the $31.4 trillion debt limit for the federal government has not yet been approved by Congress. Bloomberg claims that despite this, it has increased risk appetite in international markets. According to John Toro, head of trading at the cryptocurrency exchange Independent Reserve, the settlement of the debt-ceiling crisis is the primary cause of this morning‚Äôs favorable risk mood. Front-end financing expenses are still quite high in comparison to cryptocurrency profits, which causes long investors to have a negative carry. BTC recently climbed to above $28,500, its highest level since May 8. It has now fallen a little, but it is still over $28,000 after an increase of 4% for the day. However, the longer-term perspective still shows BTC consolidating sideways. Created by Congress in 1917, The debt ceiling or limit is a statutory limit on the amount of debt that the Treasury may accumulate. There is a limit on how much the federal government may borrow in order to pay off the debt it has already incurred. Considering that the debt ceiling is presently $31.4 trillion, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen issued a warning that, without an agreement, a default was quite possible. The agreement would suspend this debt ceiling until January 2025, removing any ceiling on the amount of additional debt that the government may issue. According to Tommy Honan, head of market research at the exchange Swyftx, it is likely that the mere relief of a debt agreement may draw traders back to the table and lead to the next significant leg-up in the price of Bitcoin. Both the overall national debt and the debt cap were $31.4 trillion as of January 2023. Since 2001, the U.S. government has spent an average of over $1 trillion more per year than it has taken in via taxes and other sources of income. It must borrow money to continue financing the payments that Congress has already approved in order to bridge the gap. U.S. President Joe Biden addressed continuing debt default discussions during his speech on the last day of the G7 conference in Japan, saying he would not accept a deal that benefits tax evaders and cryptocurrency traders. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt agree to a compromise that safeguards wealthy traders and tax evaders while putting the lives of almost a million Americans who receive food assistance in danger.‚Äù The President claims that the bipartisan debt limit deal with Republican leaders will help crypto traders among other people, and the remarks are made in opposition to it. The political polarization in America prevents the two parties from reaching a compromise during discussions about the federal budget and debt limit. In the absence of a new budget agreement, the United States may run out of money as early as next month as the national debt soars to nearly $32 trillion. In an effort to tighten tax loopholes, President Biden took a shot at ‚Äúwealthy crypto investors‚Äù earlier this month. In the general election that will take place in November 2024, Americans and the cryptocurrency sector are still optimistic that a President and government that is more supportive of the sector will be chosen.",

          "A widely followed crypto analyst is issuing a warning to investors, saying that a deep correction in the altcoin markets may be on the horizon. In a new video update, prominent crypto strategist Benjamin Cowen tells his 783,000 YouTube subscribers that history is signaling a massive downswing for altcoins. According to Cowen, the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart currently looks strong and historical data suggests that it will continue to be bullish as Bitcoin (BTC) inches closer to its halving event next year. The Bitcoin dominance index tracks how much of the total crypto market capitalization belongs to Bitcoin. A bullish BTC.D chart suggests that Bitcoin is taking a larger share of the crypto markets at the expense of altcoins. Says Cowen, ‚ÄúI think fundamentally the dominance is very bullish and if the dominance is bullish, it‚Äôs not a good thing for altcoins on their Bitcoin pairs. And if the dominance is bullish in the pre-halving year, then it tends to not be a good thing for altcoins on their USD pairs as well. That‚Äôs what history tells us. It doesn‚Äôt mean that it has to happen but that‚Äôs just what history tells us.‚Äù Cowen goes on to say that the crypto king‚Äôs dominance level breaking above 49% would be a ‚Äúrisk-off‚Äù signal and that BTC‚Äôs dominance level could rise even if Bitcoin‚Äôs price dips. ‚ÄúWe could hold the line, and we could get another push higher, but if it happens then what I would say is don‚Äôt look so closely at the price, just look to see when the dominance breaks 49% in a sustained way, and that would to me be the risk-off signal. And you could still see the dominance break 49% in a Bitcoin downtrend. I mean don‚Äôt forget . What was going on in the market then? Bitcoin was going down and the dominance was going up.‚Äù Cowen goes on to say he that believes capital will likely rotate from altcoins into Bitcoin even though the process could take time. ‚ÄúYou can see the altcoin bleeding back to Bitcoin. It‚Äôs clear as day‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs happening. It‚Äôs just a very slow process‚Ä¶ The altcoin market is likely just going to bleed back to Bitcoin for quite a long period of time, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs worthwhile to put on your (Bitcoin) maxi hat during that time until you see the altcoin market get wrecked on their Bitcoin pairs, the dominance well above the range high and only then does it make sense, in my opinion, to seriously consider the altcoin market.‚Äù I Don‚Äôt Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on Twitter , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix ¬† Featured Image: Shutterstock/Space creator/Natalia Siiatovskaia Source link",

          "The post appeared first on The highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event, scheduled for April 2024, has created a buzz in the crypto community. Many analysts and investors have predicted that leading up to the Bitcoin halving, which occurs approximately every four years, the price of BTC would enter a period of consolidation. Analyst Credible Crypto‚Äôs expectations suggest that Bitcoin‚Äôs price would range between $20,000 and $40,000 for approximately 12 months. A Bitcoin halving is when the reward for mining new blocks is cut in half. Miners receive 50% fewer bitcoins for verifying transactions. This happens approximately every four years until a total of 21 million bitcoins are generated. Expectations: ‚ÄúThe Bitcoin halving is in April 2024. Expect to go sideways between 20-40k for about 12 months which is when we accumulate as much Bitcoin as we can. Once the halving hits, we start our next bull run to 100k+ into 2025. WAGMI.‚Äù Reality: BTC makes a new ATH‚Ä¶ ‚Äî CrediBULL Crypto (@CredibleCrypto) The next Bitcoin halving is expected to occur in April 2024, around the time when the number of blocks reaches 740,000. At that point, the block reward will decrease from 6.25 bitcoins to 3.125 bitcoins. The exact date of the halving is not known because block generation time can vary, but on average, a new block is generated every ten minutes. Contrary to these expectations, the year 2023 witnessed a remarkable turn of events in the Bitcoin market. Instead of entering a sideways trend, Bitcoin had a remarkable run at the beginning of 2023. The coin experienced a notable surge since December 31st, marking a partial recovery from the significant decline it faced in 2022. However, currently, the token is encountering challenges as its value hovers around the $30,000 range.",

          "Atomic Wallet Hacked: Users Loose Millions; ZachXBT Investigating As per Atomic Wallet‚Äôs tweet, it has been hacked and as a result, user funds have been compromised. Some victims got their entire balance drained. It was confirmed that they received reports of wallets being compromised. As per ZachXBT‚Äôs investigation and analysis, some Twitter users reported losing over six figures in the attack. Atomic Wallet (AW) is a non-custodial blockchain wallet that utilizes the user‚Äôs cold storage for all the passwords and data stacked in the user‚Äôs device. It means that user‚Äôs own their backup phrase and all the private keys, and have full control over funds. AW has no access to the user‚Äôs wallet and their sensitive information. A 12-word backup is the key to the user‚Äôs wallet. It has essential significance for keeping the funds safe. Private keys are stored in the user‚Äôs device and are strongly encrypted for security and safety. The exchanges listed here deal within Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Binance Coin (BNB), Polygon (Matic), Monero (XMR), Avalanche (AVAX), Litecoin (LTC). It is important to note that Atomic Wallet enables its users to trade in over 1450 assets and amongst all, the volume of ERC20 is highest at its strength and TRC20 is in minority. According to ZachXBT, ‚Äòsomethings in the hack have been identified. The largest loss to a victim has been observed at over $2.8 Million. Victims have messaged their transaction hash to the investigators to help them investigate better. The investigation is still on and the root cause is yet to be found. On-chain investigator ZachXBT, in the past, has managed to recognize the whereabouts of the stolen funds which were sent to subordinated authorities to make arrests. He requested for the transaction hash from an affected Atomic Wallet user. As per atomicwallet.io website, Atomic Wallet is a trusted-decentralized wallet with over five million users. As per Wu Blockchain‚Äôs tweet, ‚Äòit was perhaps a supply chain attack, where the hackers meddled with the software source code on the server and left it then for ordinary users to download‚Äô As per the sources, BTC‚Äôs present cap is $526,264,020,782 with a 24-hour volume around $8,445,506,327. The ratio percentage of volume/market cap stands at 1.6% approximately. The current circulating supply of BTC is 19,392,350 BTC which is around 92.34% of the maximum supply 21,000,000 BTC. The fully diluted market cap is $570,189,560,119 of Bitcoin, at writing time. At the time of writing, Bitcoin price is $27,151.88 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $8,445,506,327 USD. Bitcoin is down by 0.14% in the last 24 hours. BTC‚Äôs price performance in the last 24 hours showed a low of $26,958 and a high of $27,317.
